// Terminal notes:
// ls - to list all the content from the folder we are in
// pwd- to give us the directory (where are we?)/ path to our working directory or location
// cd - to change the directory/move to another folder from the directory we are
// cd .. - to go back one folder
// clear - to clear the content from the terminal
// Absolute Paths: cd /Users/Anna/Documents - this works anywhere because it starts at the root
// Relative Paths: cd ../../Documents (go back two levels, until Documents folder)- it works relative to where I am at currently
// mkdir - make directory (to create a new folder)
// mdir ../Frogs - to make a new folder in the previous folder, not where I am
// man ls - it gives us a directory with a list of flags
// ls -a - it gives us the given files from that folder
// ls -l - it gives us more info about the files we have in the folder, such as modification time/last update
// touch - to create a file. If we use touch with a file that already exists, it will update/replace it.
// rm - to remove files. When we use this, the file won't go to the recycle bin but will be gone forever
// rmdir - to remove folders. It only removes empty folders.
// rm -rf - to remove a folder and everything what's inside.
